### The Blue Guy is a simple roguelike game (WIP) where you try to survive as long as you can amongst hoards of laser beams, death balls, and more!

The blue guy is my first ever try at making a html / canvas game. I took many ideas from engines such as SFML and PyGame, except making it in html. My next projects will try to focus on working on the base game framework, animations and, websocket / multiplayer support.
